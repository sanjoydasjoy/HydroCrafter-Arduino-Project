# HydroCrafter-Arduino-Project
IoT-integrated, sensor-driven automated hydroponics for optimized plant growth and resource efficiency

# Background
Traditional agricultural practices face numerous challenges in meeting the
growing demand for fresh produce in urban areas. Limited space, soil
degradation, and water scarcity are just a few of the obstacles that hinder
conventional farming methods from thriving within densely populated cities. As
a result, urban dwellers are often disconnected from the source of their food,
relying heavily on imported produce with significant environmental and
logistical costs.
In response to these challenges, hydroponic farming has emerged as a
promising solution to revolutionize urban agriculture. By eliminating the need
for soil and maximizing resource efficiency, hydroponics offers the potential to
grow a wide variety of crops in compact indoor spaces, including homes,
apartments, and commercial buildings. However, while hydroponic systems
hold great promise, they also present unique maintenance challenges that can
deter individuals from adopting this innovative farming method.

## Introduction
Urban hydroponic farming faces a hurdle in widespread adoption due to
the labor-intensive and complex maintenance requirements. Manual
monitoring of water levels, nutrient solutions, and environmental
conditions creates a barrier for urban dwellers seeking an accessible
and efficient way to grow fresh produce at home. An automated solution
is essential to simplify the process and make hydroponic farming a
viable option for urban residents.
